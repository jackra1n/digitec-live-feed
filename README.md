# digitec-live-feed

This is a [live-feed](https://www.digitec.ch/en/wiki/2736) from the digitec.ch website.

This project was created mainly so I could learn how to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and just overall JS/TS and to create some interesting data visualizations.

This project is in no way affiliated with digitec.ch or Digitec Galaxus AG.
